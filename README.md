# Taskify

Taskify is a simple yet powerful To-Do application built with Laravel. It allows users to manage their tasks by creating
task groups, adding tasks, and collaborating with others. With role-based access control (RBAC) and email notifications,
Taskify provides a robust solution for individual and team productivity.
